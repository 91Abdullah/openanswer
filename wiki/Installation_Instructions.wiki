#summary How to install OpenAnswer on a new *nix system.

= Introduction =

In this wiki, we will go through the necessary steps to install OpenAnswer on a clean Unix/Linux based system. We will go over system recommendations and minimum system requirements, asterisk configurations, and some modifications that customizes OpenAnswer to your call center environment.

= About OpenAnswer =

OpenAnswer is an open source software package that extends the functionality of standard PBX systems (specifically Asterisk) for call centers of all sizes. OpenAnswer is used as an internal application by Open Teleservices for their answering services. The entire application is written in PHP and JavaScript, and is designed from the ground up to be easily customized.

As you can see in the minimum requirements, OpenAnswer, MySQL, Apache, PHP, and Asterisk can all run comfortably with each other on the same server or separately on several virtual machine guests on a single host. However, this isn't recommended as Asterisk and MySQL can easily devour all CPU threads and memory. Furthermore, Apache will require more children processes (and thus more memory) to provide for more synchronous connections with agents and users. We recommend separating Asterisk, OpenAnswer/Apache, and MySQL into different servers or one really big virtualized server. The requirements for the clients are even smaller, particularly because OpenAnswer is designed to be as light as possible while in the browser. But to the actual installation.



This installation assumes that you have prior knowledge with Apache, MySQL, and Asterisk. This guide won't guide you through setting up your web environment/phone system. We will assume that you have MySQL, Apache, and Asterisk configured to your liking. If you need help setting up your environment, hire a consultant because you're way over your head.

  # Import the OpenAnswer.sql file into your new database
  # While in your favorite MySQL editor, run the following two commands to create a super user.
    {{{
INSERT INTO `users` (`user_name`,`pass`,`name`) VALUES ('admin',MD5('pass'),'Administrator');
}}}
{{{
